#### About the Website
This website is for anyone who may need a cockatil recipe for an event they are hosting or if they just want to expirement with any alcohol they have at home. 

The Top Shelf website allows the user to easily navigate by selecting an alcohol that they wish to be the base of their recipe. They are then presented with a list of cockatils that are can be produced from the selected Alcohol. Once the user selects a cocktail they are presented with a list fo the ingredients required to make the cocktail, followed by the instructions on how to make it.

If a user comes across a new cockatil recipe that they wish to add to the website, thye can easily do so. They need to navigate to the login page where they should register as a new user. Once registered, they need to login with their username and password. After they have logged in they should navigate to the 'Add a Cockatil' page where they can provide all the required information to add their favourite new cocktail to the website.

A logged in user who is returnign to the website can view a list of all the cocktails that they have uplaoded to the website in the past. From there they can edit an existing recipe if they have found a nicer recipe for the cocktail. They can also delete the recipe if they don't wish it to be on display.

A user who is looking for a non-alcolohic cockatil would navigate to the Mocktails section of the website from the home page, here they will find a list of the non-alcoholic cocktails.
